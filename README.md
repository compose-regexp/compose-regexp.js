# compose-regexp.js

Build and compose *maintainable* regular expressions in JavaScript. 

Regular expressions don't do justice to regular grammars.

- The regular grammar/language formalism is all about [expression composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_language&oldid=748009543#Formal_definition).
- Yet RegExps were designed as a [write-only syntax for command line tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_expression&oldid=762174774#History) like `ed` and `grep`.
- Building large expressions from smaller, abstracted patterns is not possible using RegExp literals.

This makes complex RegExps hard to read, debug and modify... 

`compose-regexp` to the rescue!

It doesn't make regular grammars more powerful, they are still [fundamentally limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chomsky_hierarchy&oldid=762040114#The_hierarchy), but since they are ubiquitous, we may as well have better tooling to implement them...

## Usage

```Shell
$ npm install --save compose-regexp
```

```JS
import {
    sequence, either, capture,
    ref, greedy, flags, avoid
} from "compose-regexp"; // can be required too

// the example that made me write this, in order to ~lex JS.
// It matches braces in source code, but skips comments and strings.
let matcher = flags('gm',
    either(
        sequence(
            capture(/['"`]/),
            greedy('*', // a greedy zero-or-more repetition
                either(
                    sequence('\\', ref(1)),
                    '\\\\',
                    sequence(avoid(ref(1)), /[\s\S]/)
                )
            ),
            ref(1)
        ),
        sequence(
            '/*',
            greedy('*',
                avoid('*/'),
                /[\s\S]/
            ),
            '*/'
        ),
        sequence('//', /[^\n]*\n/),
        capture(either(/[{}]/, '}}'))
    )
);

// matcher:

/(?:(['"`])(?:(?:\\\1|\\\\|(?!\1)[\s\S]))*\1|\/\*(?:(?!\*\/)[\s\S])*\*\/|\/\/[^\n]*\n|((?:[{}]|\}\})))/gm

// The most astute among you may have noticed that regexes in the subject string
// would still trip that parser. Not perfect, but still useful.
```

## API

### General (important) notes:

The `regexp` parameters of these functions can be either RegExps or strings.
Special characters in strings are escaped, so that `'.*'` is equivalent to `/\.\*/`.
Therefore:

```JS
> sequence('.', '*').source
'\\.\\*'
```

The flags of intermediate regexps are ignored, and always reset to false unless set by `flags()`.

#### flags(opts, regexps...)

```JavaScript
> flags('gm', /a/)
/a/gm
```

#### either(regexps...) 

```JS
> either(/a/, /b/, /c/)
/(?:a|b|c)/
```

#### sequence(regexps...) 

```JS
> sequence(/a/, /b/, /c/)
/abc/
```

#### group(regexps...)

```JS
> group(/a/, /b/, /c/)
/(?:abc)/
```

#### optional(regexps...)

```JS
> optional(/a/, /b/, /c/)
/(?:abc)?/
```

#### lookAhead(regexps...)

```JS
> lookAhead(/a/, /b/, /c/)
/(?=abc)/
```

#### avoid(regexps...) 

Negative look ahead

```JS
> avoid(/a/, /b/, /c/)
/(?!abc)/
```

#### greedy(suffix, regexprs...) 

Valid suffixes: (`?`, `*`, `+`, `{n}`, `{n,}` and `{m, n}`)

```JS
> greedy("*", either(/a/, /b/, /c/))
/(?:a|b|c)*/
> maybe = greedy.bind(null, '?'); maybe(either('a', 'b'))
/(?:a|b)?/
```

#### frugal(suffix, regexprs...) 

Like `greedy()` but for non-greedy operators (`??`, `*?`, `+?`, `{n}?`, `{n,}?` and `{m, n}?`).

```JS
> frugal("{1,3}", either(/a/, /b/, /c/))
/(?:a|b|c){1,3}?/
```

#### capture (regexprs...)

```JS
> capture(/a/, /b/, /c/)
/(abc)/
```

#### ref(n) 

```JS
> ref(1)
/\1/
```

*Caveat emptor*, references are absolute. Therefore, refs may be broken if you compose two regexps that use captures.

```JS

stringMatcher = sequence(
    capture(/['"`]/),
    greedy('*', // a greedy zero-or-more repetition
        either(
            sequence('\\', ref(1)),
            '\\\\',
            sequence(avoid(ref(1)), /[\s\S]/)
        )
    ),
    ref(1)
)

whooops = sequence(
    capture('foo'),
    stringMatcher
)
```

In `whoops`, the `ref(1)` in stringMatcher actually refers to `foo`, not the opening quote.

Fixing this would require an approach far more complex than what I'm doing now (concat the regexps source).

## Notes

This tool is very simple under the hood and its output is not optimised for either size or speed. For example, you may find that some non-capturing groups are superfluous. Getting rid of these would require parsing the regexps under the hood to simplify them, and it is beyond the scope of this project at this time.
